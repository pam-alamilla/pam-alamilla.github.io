I’m Pam, a computational biologist with a strong foundation in human genomics and bioinformatics. I’m particularly interested in using machine learning to uncover hidden patterns of disease in large multiomic datasets.

I recently completed a Master of Health Science in Medical Genomics at the University of Toronto, where I gained hands-on experience in generating, analyzing, and interpreting next-generation sequencing data. The program featured rigorous coursework in advanced human genetics, biostatistics, computational biology, and the communication of genetic information.

My training culminated in a practicum at Deep Genomics, an AI-driven drug discovery company, where I explored methods for integrating and analyzing multimodal biological data. Following the practicum, I continued the project as a research intern with the company.

Outside of science, I enjoy weightlifting, all kinds of crafting, and reading - mostly non-fiction and memoirs.
